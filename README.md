# task-2

This is Task-2 android mobile automation for acceptance testing using CodeceptJS and Appium

## What is CodeceptJS?

CodeceptJS is a framework for writing end-to-end tests for web applications. It abstracts common interaction with pages to simple methods and can use basically anything that implements WebDriver specification as it’s backend. So you’re not tied to Selenium here. It’s very well documented so make sure to check out its website!
I like it especially for its simple API and the fact that it’s written in pure ES6 supported by node without transpiler, so there’s no need for additional dependency in form of Babel or whatever equivalent.
Thank you Michael Bodnarchuk for that!

## What is Appium?

Appium is an open source test automation framework for use with native, hybrid and mobile web apps.
It drives iOS, Android, and Windows apps using the WebDriver protocol.
